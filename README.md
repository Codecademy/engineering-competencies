## FAQ

### Do I have to do everything at my level to meet expectations?

When reading the engineering competencies for your level you should work with your manager to determine areas that you would like to work on and areas that they feel you need to work on to help you grow and attain the various skills that are described above.
It is not expected that each engineer is working on all areas at any given point in time; rather, it is assumed that over time one demonstrates proficiency in all areas.

It is important to first focus on meeting the criteria at your current level, before focusing on the expectations at the level above you.
Establishing a strong performance baseline at your level will further set you up for success to grow to the next level.

### How long does it take to establish a track record?

The further you progress in your career the more time it will take to demonstrate proficiency in specific areas.
Certain competencies include “established a track record of”. Generally it takes a minimum of 3-4 quarters to be able to repeat a certain set of expectations and demonstrate consistent proficiency.
