## FAQ

### Why these competencies?

We've found that these four competency areas capture much of what's worked well for us.
The attributes espoused here have been what we've commonly seen help engineers thrive at Codecademy and similar engineering organizations.

We believe a team should prosper and grow _as a team_: that its success is measured by both the quality and throughput of its output _and_ the personal growth and enjoyment of its individual members.
Strong technical achievements are only half of that.
Fostering a collaborative community is also necessary for us to be a great place to work.

#### Why Software Engineering & Design?

To be a strong engineer, you need strong development chops.
That spans the gamut of the core tasks you'll be doing here, from the granular act of writing code to the larger-scale process of designing and maintaining systems.
We actively appreciate that our industry is rapidly evolving and new best practices and standards are always around the corner.
We need engineers who bring in those fresh ideas to be able to produce our best work.

#### Why Execution & Results?

On top of the core development fundamentals, successful engineers are ones who ship products and are able to reliably do so on time with high quality.
They need to balance the various tasks they're given and, to an extent, manage their own time.
Engineers have uniquely deep insight into their work, and often need to drive it forward.

#### Why Collaboration & Communication?

Teams are more than the sum of their parts, and as an engineer, part of your responsibilities are that everyone is given the resources to work their best.
Strong team members both communicate the current progress and blockers of their own work, in order to keep their peers from getting stuck, and share feedback regularly that shape the code and product to be the best it can be

#### Why Community & Citizenship?

Part of being on a team is contributing to benefit the whole -- beyond accomplishing your own todo list.
We want everyone to push the team culture forward and actively participate in it.
Strong team players will identify areas of improvement in our culture and work towards making them better.

### Do I have to do everything at my level to meet expectations?

When reading the engineering competencies for your level you should work with your manager to determine areas that you would like to work on and areas that they feel you need to work on to help you grow and attain the various skills that are described above.
It is not expected that each engineer is working on all areas at any given point in time; rather, it is assumed that over time one demonstrates proficiency in all areas.

It is important to first focus on meeting the criteria at your current level, before focusing on the expectations at the level above you.
Establishing a strong performance baseline at your level will further set you up for success to grow to the next level.

### How long does it take to establish a track record?

The further you progress in your career the more time it will take to demonstrate proficiency in specific areas.
Certain competencies include “established a track record of”. Generally it takes a minimum of 3-4 quarters to be able to repeat a certain set of expectations and demonstrate consistent proficiency.
