# Codecademy Engineering Competencies

These are the evaluation criteria we use for performance evaluation and leveling on the Codecademy engineering team. The compentencies at each level are broken down into four categories:

1. Software Engineering & Design
2. Execution & Results
3. Collaboration & Communication
4. Community & Citizenship

Within each of these categories, we have further broken down the list into competencies that are applicable at every level and competencies that are only applicable at particular Software Engineer levels. Thes are designed to be cumulative; skills that are expected at Software Engineer 2, for example, are also expected at Senior Software Engineer & beyond.

- You ask thoughtful questions and challenge assumptions to ensure you are solving the right problems.

#### Software Engineer Intern
- You work collaboratively with your manager and senior engineers in order to meet the above expectations.

#### Software Engineer
- You sometimes work collaboratively with your manager and senior engineers in order to meet the above expectations, but work independently in most cases.

#### Software Engineer 2

- You encourage other engineers on the team to follow the same best practices you bring to design & technical decisions.
- You help other engineers on the end to end delivery of their code from design, code, tests, monitoring/alerts, deployment and rollout.

#### Senior Software Engineer

- You facilitate technical discussions on the team and making sure other engineers follow the same best practices.
- You listen attentively to team members’ ideas and concerns, consider their viewpoints, and ask clarifying questions that elicit clearer responses.

## FAQ

### Do I have to do everything at my level to meet expectations?

When reading the engineering competencies for your level you should work with your manager to determine areas that you would like to work on and areas that they feel you need to work on to help you grow and attain the various skills that are described above.
It is not expected that each engineer is working on all areas at any given point in time; rather, it is assumed that over time one demonstrates proficiency in all areas.

It is important to first focus on meeting the criteria at your current level, before focusing on the expectations at the level above you.
Establishing a strong performance baseline at your level will further set you up for success to grow to the next level.

### How long does it take to establish a track record?

The further you progress in your career the more time it will take to demonstrate proficiency in specific areas.
Certain competencies include “established a track record of”. Generally it takes a minimum of 3-4 quarters to be able to repeat a certain set of expectations and demonstrate consistent proficiency.
