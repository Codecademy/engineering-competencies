# Takehome Grading

Hi!
These are our grading guidelines for takehome projects.
Thanks for taking a look!

These are the criteria our engineering team uses to evaluate takehome assignments.
We don't set a minimum score for any opening, and although we take these criteria very seriously, we also reserve the right to use considerations beyond these rubrics in our decision making.

## Rubrics

Here are the specific grading rubrics we use to evaluate each of our takehome assignments:

- [Backend Takehome](./backend-takehome.md)
- [Frontend Takehome](./frontend-takehome.md)

## Why?

We believe in openness and transparency in our engineering practices.
There must be _some_ criteria by which we evaluate takehome submissions, and we'd like them to be clear to everyone.

We also welcome any feedback you have on these!

## Takehome Assignment Specifications

In our opinion, an ideal takehome assignment should:

- Expect (and state) a maximum time spent as 2-3 hours
- Explain clear, easy-to-understand instructions, including:
  - Minimum requirements for a successful submission
  - Areas of work we expect the candidate to focus on
  - Areas of work we do not expect the candidate to focus on or tackle at all
- Provide enough range of complexity for submissions to demonstrate excellence in implementation
- Request a limited 'bonus'/'delighter' feature set, with multiple options suggested to match various skill sets
