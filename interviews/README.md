# Takehome Grading

Hi!
This is our grading rubric for takehome projects.
Thanks for taking a look!

These are the scores by which our engineering team evaluate backend takehome assignments.
We _don't_ establish a hard minimum of score for any opening -- these scores are a general rubric, not a hard rule.

## Rubrics

- [Intern Backend Takehome](./frontend-takehome.md)
- [Intern Frontend Takehome](./backend-takehome.md)

## Why?

We believe in openness and transparency in our engineering practices.
There must be _some_ criteria by which we evaluate takehome submissions, and if candidates are meant to be taking them, we'd like them to be clear to everyone.

We also welcome any feedback you have on these!

## Takehome Assignment Specifications

In our opinion, an ideal takehome assignment should:

- Expect (and state) a maximum time spent as 2-3 hours
- Explain clear, easy-to-understand instructions, including:
  - Minimum requirements for a successful submission
  - Areas of work we expect the candidate to focus on
  - Areas of work we do not expect the candidate to focus on or tackle at all
- Provide enough range of complexity for submissions to demonstrate excellence in implementation
- Request a limited 'bonus'/'delighter' feature set, with multiple options suggested to match various skill sets
