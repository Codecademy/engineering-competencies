# Backend Takehome Grading

## Section Scores

### Solution Completion

All requirements are met as outlined by the assignment's requirements.

- 💖 4 - Perfect
- 👍 3 - One minor bug with flow using expected inputs, or a couple bugs with validation of corner cases
- 👎 2 - Two or more missed requirements
- 🛑 1 - Several requirements missed; compile errors that are not trivial to resolve

### Code Quality

Code is generally well-organized and easy to understand.

- 💖 4 - Well-organized, DRY, easily readable, good variable/function names, would pass linter w/minimal issues
- 👍 3 - Minor repetition in logic, a couple confusing variable/function names, minor formatting issues
- 👎 2 - Not idiomatic for language chosen, difficult to understand and trace
- 🛑 1 - Unable to understand, non-standard formatting, variable names difficult to follow

### Data structures and runtime

Data structures are chosen appropriately for low complexity and low memory allocation.

- 💖 4 - Appropriate data structures; efficient use of conditionals/loops; minimal array scanning; appropriate passing of parameters and return values
- 👍 3 - Reasonable use of data structures; some opportunity for reduction of costly repeated operations; some inefficiency in usage of parameters and return values
- 👎 2 - Excessive hardcoding of control flow and repetition of the same logic
- 🛑 1 - Can enter unintended infinite loops; may not function properly; shows lack of understanding of data structures

### Testing

Unit tests verify the code is working appropriately.

- 💖 4 - Unit tests or script that tests various logic branches including edge cases; tests are granular and tied to specific functions
- 👍 3 - Unit tests or script that tests main logic branches but not edge cases; tests not tied to specific functions but rather groups of them
- 👎 2 - Unit tests/script are not repeatable
- 🛑 1 - No unit tests or scripts
