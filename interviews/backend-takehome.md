# Backend Takehome Grading

## Section Scores

### Solution Completion

All requirements are met as outlined by the assignment's requirements.

- ⭐ 4: Game plays as described for correct and incorrect guesses and edge cases. All features working, with no detectable bugs. At least two unit tests, one for correct guess, and one for incorrect guess. Tests are consistent in how they approach testing.
- 👍 3: Game mostly working as described with one smaller bug and/or doesn’t handle edge cases. Some tests generally adhere to a consistent strategy. Only one unit test for either incorrect or correct guess.
- 👎 2: Game doesn’t play as expected and/or contains multiple bugs. Tests are for unnecessary trivialities such as what kind of class returned instances are, or the shape of defined classes.
- 🛑 1: Game doesn't work. No tests.

### Code Quality

Code is generally well-organized and easy to understand.

- ⭐ 4: Clear distinction between different logic areas, such as presentational versus game. Well organized, DRY, easily readable. All functions have clear names; none have multiple purposes or span many dozens of lines.
- 👍 3: Organization generally adheres to understandable separations of concerns. Occasional unused variables. Two or three major functions used for the majority of game logic.
- 👎 2: Many unnecessary repeated operations, conditionals, and/or variables. Confusing logical structures that are difficult to follow. Very poorly named variables and/or functions that hamper code readability.
- 🛑 1: Very difficult to understand; non-standard formatting; variable names confusing.

### Data Structures and Organization

Data structures are chosen appropriately for low complexity and low memory allocation.

- ⭐ 4: Optimally efficient algorithms for the problem, with no unnecessary work. Some small non-critical operations unnecessarily create new memory or spend extra time.
- 👍 3: No major efficiency defects, but some minor optimizations missed. Uses correct data structures such as maps or sets when working with small-scale operations. Somewhat suboptimal time and/or space complexity solution.
- 👎 2: Major operations unnecessarily create new memory or spend extra time. Incorrect data structures used in some hot paths.
- 🛑 1: Can enter unintended infinite loops; may not function properly; shows lack of understanding of data structures

### Bonus

This category may be used as a tie-breaker for candidates who score similarly in other categories. Please [review the challenge requirements for the bonus](https://github.com/Codecademy/internship-code-challenge/tree/master/backend#bonus)
Note that bonus points may be reduced if Solution Quality is not great.
Note that candidates can get a maximum of 4 points regardless of how many delighters they have completed.

- ⭐ 4: It works as described, with most or all edge cases covered. Bonus code maintains the same quality bar as the rest of the code.
- 👍 3: Works somewhat as described, with some missing edge cases or core functionality. Bonus code has decreased quality compared to the rest of the code.
- 👎 2: Little to no delighter was completed.
