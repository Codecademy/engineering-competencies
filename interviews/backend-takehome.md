# Backend Takehome Grading

## Section Scores

### Solution Completion

All requirements are met as outlined by the assignment's requirements.

- ⭐ 4: All stated requirements satisfied. Handles edge cases. Has two or more passing tests.
- 👍 3: One minor bug with flow using expected inputs or a couple of bugs around corner cases. One passing test.
- 👎 2: Two or more missed requirements. Tests are for unnecessary trivialities.
- 🛑 1: Several requirements missed; compile errors that are not trivial to resolve. No tests.

### Code Quality

Code is generally well-organized and easy to understand.

- ⭐ 4: Well-organized; DRY; easily readable; good variable/function names; would pass linter with few issues.
- 👍 3: Minor repetition in logic; a couple of confusing variable/function names; minor formatting issues.
- 👎 2: Not idiomatic for language chosen; difficult to understand and trace.
- 🛑 1: Very difficult to understand; non-standard formatting; variable names confusing.

### Backend Knowledge

Data structures are chosen appropriately for low complexity and low memory allocation.
See [Backend Specifics](#backend-specifics) below.

- ⭐ 4: Appropriate data structures; efficient use of conditionals/loops; minimal array scanning; appropriate passing of parameters and return values.
- 👍 3: Reasonable use of data structures; some opportunity for reduction of costly repeated operations; some inefficiency in usage of parameters and return values.
- 👎 2: Excessive hardcoding of control flow and repetition of the same logic.
- 🛑 1: Can enter unintended infinite loops; may not function properly; shows lack of understanding of data structures

### Delighters

This category may be used as a tie-breaker for candidates who score similarly in other categories.

Note that bonus points may be reduced if Solution Quality is not great.

- ⭐️ 4: Requested delighter content completed fully.
- 👍 3: Requested delighter mostly completed or completed with a few minor bugs/flaws.
- 👎 2: Little to no delighter was completed.

## Backend Specifics

### What We Look For

- Use of your chosen language’s best practices.
- Concise, readable code
- Performance considerations

### What We Ignore

We don't penalize candidates for consistent style choices that don't demonstrate significant knowledge gaps.

- Nitpicks: we don't require completely optimal declarative or functional patterns
- Style: e.g. files and folder structures; formatting/whitespace; grouping, naming, or sorting...
